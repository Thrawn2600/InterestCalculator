# InterestCalculator
A little interest calculator with fun graphics

This is a project for a CS class where I learned C++. It was fun to add some ASCII Graphics, it was a little difficult integrating python at first. I got the hang of it eventually and really enjoyed working on this little app. I thought the graphics were something I did particulatrly well. They made the project a little more fun. The most challenging part was getting my IDE setup to work with python and C++ after that was done it was smooth sailing. There is a lot of good info on stack overflow about how to use these two languages together. I am sure integrating programming languages will be a skill I continue to use in the future.
